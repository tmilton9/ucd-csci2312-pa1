## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 1

_working with objects_

* * *

pa1 is a program that asked for the user to input 3 points on a x y z coordinate.

as the user inputs the data the program calls a class of Point and creates a new point using the constructor.

once all 9 coordinates are entered the program then calls three instances of the distance function to find out the lengths of the sides of the triangle a-b b-c a-c 

after all three sides are known the program runs a function that finds the area of the circle using Herons formula.

it then displays the area and returns 0 to exit
